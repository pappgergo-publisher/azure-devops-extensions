Documentation and main page of the Flexible Approvals extension.

## Introduction

The Flexible Approvals extension provides a quick and easy-to-setup way to 
include approvals into any parts of YAML pipelines where tasks can be put.

The extension contains 
- agent and server tasks for creating and waiting for approval requests,
- a tab on the YAML pipeline runs to see and approve/reject the approval requests for that run,
- pages to see all approval requests in one place and to check your approvals,
- pages to maintain approver delegates and to find your delegates or delegators,
- widgets to allow filtered listing of approvals and delegates for dashboards.

On top of these, it is possible to turn off parts of Flexible Approvals' offerings for individual 
projects or for the whole organization.
